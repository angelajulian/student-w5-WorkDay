# Work Day Scheduler

Scheduling a whole week can be too taxing. Scheduling a day is a great place to start when organizing your time.

## How to Use

Work day shows an 8 hour day, split into hour segments. Click a block to enter an appointment, task or chore! Click the save button to save the task. You can leave and come back, and so long as you don't clear your cache, you task will be visible.

### Room for improvement

Right now, the tasks are saved based on hour. The workday is also only from 9am-5pm. Here are some possible improvements:

- change data structure so that tasks are based on hour and Day/Month/Year.
- allow switching between days to see past and future events
- allow the user to set work hours

## Technology used

This app uses Bootstrap for styling, Moment.js for time tracking, JQuery, javascript, CSS and HTML.
